Additionally, a map of NYC shows use where people like to start, mainly in Manhatten a very busy location, and a heatmap showing the amount of time a bike is use which would likely need repair. 

Additional visualizations could be added like a graph containing the age of customer in specfic columns to determine what age group would be idea to promote the program.
